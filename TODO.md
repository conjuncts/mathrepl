multiline code cells


virtual keyboard zoom to place
mathfield cursor not at right location

cursor position is bugged on onset, allowing you to insert a row from the beginning

unable to delete rows

issue with parentheses not being placed when substituting V_0 as an integral whereas x+y+z works
Minimal example: let $$V_0 = \int_3^9xdx$$
substituting $$3(V_0)^2$$ prod
