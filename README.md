# MathREPL

Proof of concept. Since this was made in a short period of time, it will use eval() a lot
and thus the prototype will have many security issues. This is done as a proof of concept and 
ideally the usable version will not have these evals.

Heavily dependent on the amazing cortex.io libraries mathlive and compute-engine.

Thanks to font awesome for the incredible icons.
